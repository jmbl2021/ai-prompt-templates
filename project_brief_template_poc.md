## 1. THE GOAL

### What I'm Trying to Achieve
<!-- One clear sentence about what success looks like -->

### Why This Matters
<!-- The problem or opportunity this addresses -->

### Done Looks Like
<!-- 2-3 specific outcomes that mean this worked -->
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

---

## 2. WHAT I HAVE

### Inputs
**I have this data/input:**
- Format: [files, API, database, manual entry]
- Sample or description:
```
[Paste actual sample if available, or describe it]
```

**I DON'T have:** [What's missing or unclear about the input]

### Current State
<!-- Where are you starting from? -->
- Existing code/tools: [If any]
- What I've already tried: [If anything]
- What I know won't work: [If anything]

---

## 3. WHAT I NEED

### Must Produce
<!-- What's the actual deliverable? -->
- **Output format:** [file type, display, report, etc.]
- **Key information it must contain:**
  1. 
  2. 
  3. 

**Example of what "good" looks like:**
```
[Rough sketch or description]
```

### How It Should Work (roughly)
<!-- Describe the flow in plain language -->
1. Start with [input]
2. Do something to [transform/analyze/process it]
3. End up with [output]

**The part I'm fuzzy on:** [What you need help figuring out]

---

## 4. CONSTRAINTS

### Hard Requirements
<!-- What MUST be true? -->
- [ ] Must work with [specific tech/format]
- [ ] Must handle [specific scale/volume]
- [ ] Must avoid [specific approach/technology]

### Preferences
<!-- Nice to have, but flexible -->
- Prefer [approach/technology] if possible
- Would like [feature] but not essential

### Known Limitations
<!-- What can we ignore for a POC? -->
- Don't worry about: [error handling, edge cases, UI polish, etc.]
- Acceptable to assume: [ideal conditions, happy path, etc.]

---

## 5. WHAT I NEED HELP WITH

### Logic/Algorithm
<!-- Check all that apply -->
- [ ] I know exactly how it should work → [describe it]
- [ ] I have a rough idea → [sketch it out]
- [ ] I need help designing the approach → [describe the problem]

### Implementation Decisions
**Questions I need answered:**
1. [What's the best way to...?]
2. [Should I use X or Y for...?]
3. [How do I handle...?]

---

## 6. ONE CONCRETE EXAMPLE

### Walk Through One Real Scenario

**Starting with this:**
```
[Actual input example]
```

**I want to end up with this:**
```
[Actual desired output]
```

**The transformation involves:**
[Describe in plain language what needs to happen]

---

## 7. TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### My Environment
- **Language:** [Python, JavaScript, etc.]
- **Where this runs:** [local machine, server, cloud, etc.]
- **What I have installed:** [relevant tools, libraries]
- **What I can install:** [any limitations?]

### Integration Points
- Does this need to connect to: [APIs, databases, files, etc.]
- Authentication: [if needed, what kind]

---

## 8. QUICK CHECKS

**Red flags to watch for:**
- [ ] If [scenario] happens, it should [behavior]
- [ ] This definitely shouldn't [undesired behavior]

**How I'll know it works:**
- [ ] Test it with [specific input]
- [ ] Should produce [specific result]
- [ ] Verify by [how I'll check]

---

## 9. CONTEXT DUMP

### Anything Else Relevant
<!-- Brain dump everything that might matter -->
<!-- Links, screenshots, error messages, related docs, etc. -->

### What I've Learned So Far
<!-- If you've already tried things -->
- Discovered: [findings]
- Doesn't work: [failed approaches]
- Confused about: [unclear aspects]

---

## QUICK START CHECKLIST

Before asking AI for help:
- [ ] I've stated the goal in one sentence
- [ ] I've provided at least ONE real example
- [ ] I've clarified what I have vs what I need
- [ ] I've identified what I need help figuring out
- [ ] I've listed any hard constraints
